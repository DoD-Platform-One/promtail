            # Control Implementation
              a. Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit function for organization-defined event types that the system is capable of logging;
              b. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged;
              c. Specify the following event types for logging within the system organization-defined event types (subset of the event types defined in AU-2a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) logging for each identified event type;
              d. Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for logging are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and
              e. Review and update the event types selected for logging on an organization-defined frequency.

              Logging daemons are present on each node that BigBang is installed on.  Out of the box, the following events are captured:
              * all containers emitting to STDOUT or STDERR (captured  by container runtime translating container logs to /var/log/containers).
              * all kubernetes api server requests.
              * all events emitted by the kubelet.

              This control is fully implemented by this tool.

            # Control Implementation
              Logs are captured by promtail from the node. The node logs will contain the necessary log data from all pods/applications inside the selected nodes.
              Validating `logfmt` as the config.logFormat would be the goal. This is currently a secret mounted to /etc/promtail/promtail.yaml in the promtail container. We will ensure the promtail.yaml file is at a minimum the target config.
